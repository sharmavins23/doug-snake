            <p>
                I was watching random YouTube videos when I came across
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DougDoug">DougDoug</a>'s
                latest creation,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnN6eBamwj4"
                    >I forced ChatGPT to make a sequel to Snake</a
                >. While his video's implementation was fairly lackluster, I
                felt the concept of a Snake sequel with a variety of
                questionable additions far too enjoyable to pass up.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, here is my implementation of DougDoug's sequel to
                Snake. Click the game to start. Press the spacebar or click to
                pause, and use the WASD or arrow keys to move. Enjoy!
