# DougDoug's Sequel to Snake

I was watching random YouTube videos when I came across
[DougDoug](https://www.youtube.com/@DougDoug)'s latest creation,
[I forced ChatGPT to make a sequel to Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnN6eBamwj4).
While his video's implementation was fairly lackluster, I felt the concept of a
Snake sequel with a variety of questionable additions far too enjoyable to pass
up. My aim isn't on improving each and every feature, but simply adding them in
a way that 'works' well enough while still encapsulating the chaotic nature of
the original work.

As such, [here is my implementation](https://sharmavins23.github.io/doug-snake/)
of DougDoug's sequel to Snake.

## Features

### Currently Added Features

-   The initial game of snake is completed, with a full (basic) feature set.
-   Sound effects play when an apple is picked up.
-   When the game ends and you lose, the
    [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS8OawQegYE) "Snake?! SNAAAAKE!" from
    Metal Gear Solid (1998) plays.

### Features to be Added

-   The snake is represented by Guy Fieri.
-   Food runs away from the snake.
-   The game has RPG-like stats. When you level up, the Minecraft
    [level-up sound effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-LZWxCYcKM) plays.
-   The game contains microtransactions. The user may buy arbitrary items at
    arbitrary prices, and must enter a credit card number in order to properly
    buy the item. For instance, super speed, extra XP gain, increased growth
    rate, and bonus lives were purchaseable from the video.
-   An american flag displays in the background.
-   Lore!
-   Physics!
-   End credits!
-   The color of the snake changes every frame. There is a 1/10 chance that
    coloration is 'rainbow'.

## Credits

Obviously, credits to DougDoug's YouTube channel for the idea. I simply worked
on the implementation in VanillaJS.
